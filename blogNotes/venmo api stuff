venmo api stuff

venmo api has a great getting started page here :https://developer.venmo.com/docs/quickstart
but there are a few problems. One is that there is no place
in the venmo developers tab to add a new application.
You can still do so by going directly to this url https://venmo.com/account/app/new

For developement, I chose to just use http://localhost:3000
for my redirect url.

The basics of auth:
In order to have the user sign in with their venmo account, you simply redirect the user to 'https://api.venmo.com/v1/oauth/authorize?client_id=******&scope=**some scope(s)**'

where ****** is your client id (found on your developer page). Scopes are parameters that you set which set capabilities you will have if the user gives you permision. For example, the access_email scope would allow you to access the user's email.

When the user signes in, they will be redirected to the redirect url you specified for the app. At the end of that url, venmo adds the access token for that user. This token will allow the client to do only those things that the scopes allow. So if you didn't use the make_payments scope, this token will not let you make payments for the user.
